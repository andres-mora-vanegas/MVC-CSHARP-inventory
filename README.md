# MVC-CSHARP-inventory
system of inventory developed with mvc c# and entity framework

Is a basic project developed with php and I try to migrate to mvc framework with visual studio

How it works

Use a mysql database that has multiple tables like, products, clients, bills, providers, sales etc... and use the basics operations like create, update, delete and show but using emails to administrators when the products comes to a minimun number to notify and do an action like buy new products or disable the products, use process with jquery to make the sale and finally generate a reports like how sales have today.
